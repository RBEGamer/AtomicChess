06.29.2002 - Initial Release

01.09.2007 - Back on developing. Heavy software refactoring with parsing
code completely rewritten. Pgn parsing improved in many respects:
correctness, error-handling, performance, but still working on it.
Library still functional incomplete (no variations, no glyphs, ...) and not
usable for pratical purposes.

09.06.2011 - Compilation problems fixed (mainly by Arnaud Quirin, thank you!). 

07.08.2011 - Bug fixes and Makefile improvement by JMM (thanks!). Pgn parsing
improved in supporting variations and glyphs (still no access methods for such
objects are provided). 

09.06.2013 - Several extensions: new class Position with FEN support. 
Now possibile to get the full starting square in a Ply object. 
New Color type for pieces and Square objects are now aware of the Pieces 
standing on them. More minor changes and bug-fixes.

09.14.2013 - Just a couple of bug-fix found in Position class and three new code
samples. 

10.20.2013 - Improved 'stl-compliance' for container classes (GameCollection,
MoveList,...). Iterators should now work a little better with stl algorithms.

10.23.2016 - Fixed two nasty bugs in Ply and Square class.

11.03.2016 - Improved support for fen string and Position (castle rights)

10.01.2017 - Full support for fen notation in class Position.
