 1. What's pgnlib?
 ---------------------

 pgnlib is a c++ class library for linux intending to provide a simple 
 programming interface to PGN chess games collections.

 2. Supported Systems
 --------------------

 For the time being I have tested pgnlib only on my own machine, a 
 red-hat linux 7.1 (kernel 2.4.2-2).

 pgnlib source code should be standard enough, so I'm confident it
 should work also on your system. 

 Let me know!


 3. Installation
 ---------------

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ su
 # make install


 4. Usage
 --------

 Unfortunately there isn't yet any documentation available on pgnlib.
 No man page, no texinfo, no manual, nothing.
 I hope to write down something as soon as possible.

 In the meanwhile you can rely on four sample programs showing basic 
 usage of pgnlib.
 Look for './example_X/" dirs, cd into them and look at the example_X.cpp
 file.

 If you want to build the examples you have to install pgnlib first (see
 previous 'Installation' section) and then
 $ cd ./example_1
 $ make
