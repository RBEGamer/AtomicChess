  Send build result to GitLab. It will be visible in the commit and/or merge request UI as appropriate. You must have at least one GitLab connection/server configured in the Jenkins global configuration. If you have more than one, select the appropriate one from the 'GitLab connection' dropdown menu in the job configuration.
