    <p>The branch regex allows to limit the execution of this job to certain branches. Any branch matching the specified pattern triggers
      the job. No filtering is performed if the field is left empty.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre># Allow execution for debug and release branches: (.*debug.*|.*release.*) </pre>
    <pre># Ignore any branch with `Release` or `release` as subword: ^(?:(?![R|r]elease).)*$ </pre>
