	  Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user
	  experience for mobile, web, and desktop from a single
	  codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by
	  developers and organizations around the world, and is
	  free and open source.

	  The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting
	  Flutter applications. It implements Flutter's core
	  libraries, including animation and graphics, file and
	  network I/O, accessibility support, plugin architecture,
	  and a Dart runtime and compile toolchain. Most developers
	  will interact with Flutter via the Flutter Framework,
	  which provides a modern, reactive framework, and a rich
	  set of platform, layout and foundation widgets.
