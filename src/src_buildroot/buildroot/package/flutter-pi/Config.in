	  A light-weight Flutter Engine Embedder. Flutter-pi also
	  runs without X11, so you don't need to boot into a
	  Desktop & have X11 or Wayland load up; just boot into the
	  command-line.

	  Although flutter-pi is only tested on a Rasberry Pi 4
	  2GB, it should work fine on other linux platforms supported
	  by Flutter so long as there is support for KMS and DRI.
