<p>Create one simple example, and use that for to show different styling:
<a href="https://github.com/mliebelt/PgnViewerJS/issues/64">Ticket 64 at GitHub</a>. Create different examples, that are identical
but different in using the new parameter layout.</p>

<h3>Layout Left</h3>

<p>Brings the board to the left, and moves to the right.</p>
<div id="b1" style="width: 800px"></div>

<h3>Layout Right</h3>

<p>The opposite, board to the right, rest to left.</p>

<div id="b2" style="width: 800px"></div>

<h3>Experiment: No size of whole</h3>

<div id="b3"></div>

<h3>Experiment: No size of whole and board</h3>

<div id="b4"></div>
