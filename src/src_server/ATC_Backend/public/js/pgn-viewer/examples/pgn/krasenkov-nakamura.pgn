{ It is only move 20, but Black seems to be facing some serious problems. White
threatens both 21.Nxe7+ and 21.Bxf6, and it is not clear how to simultaneously
parry both threats. Krasenkow was probably expecting 20...Bb4, but that does
not solve all of Black's problems after 21.Rxe8+ Rxe8 22.Bc3 (see below).
Nakamura's choice does not seem to help either: } 20...Rxc6 { Black takes care
of the first threat, but what about the second one? } ( 20...Bb4?! 21.Rxe8+ Rxe8 22.Bc3 Qc5 ( 22...Bxc3 23.Rxb6 Nxb6 24.Nf1 { with Ne3 to follow, when
Black will not have enough compensation. } ) 23.Nxb4 axb4 24.Bxb4 Qf5 25.Qf3 Qxf3 26.Bxf3 { and the endgame is very pleasant for White. } ) 21.Bxf6 { What
now? Black's queen, rook, and dark-squared bishop are all under fire, and it
looks like the only way to retain a defensible position is to sacrifice the
queen with 21...Nxf6, although Black will not have nearly enough compensation.
However, Nakamura had very, very different thoughts on his mind: } 21...Qxf2+!! { A
move that should be framed in the Louvre, perhaps replacing the Mona Lisa.
Black is not exploiting any inherent weaknesses in White's position, but
merely utilizing the concrete arrangement of pieces on the board - an
arrangement that permits a sacrifice of such rare beauty. Black's idea is
revealed on the next move: } 22.Kxf2 ( 22.Kh1 Rxf6 23.Ne4 Qa7 24.Nxf6+ Nxf6 { is completely lost. } ) 22...Bc5+ { And now, to his horror, Krasenkow realized
that 23.Kf1 is impossible on account of 23...c3+, when the dormant a6 springs
to life in volcano-like fashion. With the first rank entirely off-limits, the
naked king has no choice but to venture even deeper into the danger zone. } 23.Kf3 ( 23.Kf1 c3+ 24.Re2 { and now } 24...c2! { is most accurate, when White loses
everything: } 25.Qxc2 Bxe2+ 26.Ke1 Bd3+ 27.Kd1 Bxc2+ 28.Kxc2 Rxf6 ) ( 23.Re3 Bxe3+ 24.Ke1 { offers no relief either: } 24...Bxd2+ 25.Kxd2 Rd6+ 26.Kc3 Rxd1 27.Rxd1 Nxf6 { and White ends up down a piece and two pawns. } ) ( 23.Bd4 Bxd4+ 24.Kf3 Rf6+ 25.Kg4 Ne5+ { is practically a transposition to the game. } ) 23...Rxf6+ { Once the sacrifice is discovered, most of the work is already done.
With the king completely exposed, Black does not even need to calculate -
every move is perfectly natural. } 24.Kg4 Ne5+ 25.Kg5 ( 25.Rxe5 Bc8+ 26.Kh4 Rxe5 { and there is no defense against the crushing ...Rh6+. } ) ( 25.Kh5 Bc8 26.Ne4 Rf5+ 27.Ng5 g6+ 28.Kh4 { Black has a few ways to win, but the beautiful } 28...Rf4+!! 29.gxf4 Bf2# { is the quickest! } ) ( 25.Kh3 Rh6+ 26.Qh5 Rxh5# ) 25...Rg6+ 26.Kh5 f6 { Notice that all of White's pieces are still on the first or
second rank, and none of them can even come close to helping the ailing
monarch. His gigantic material advantage could not have mattered less! } 27.Rxe5 ( 27.Bd5+ Kh8 28.Kh4 Rh6+ 29.Qh5 { does allow White to escape immediate
checkmate, but suffice it to say that after } 29...g5+ 30.Kh3 Rxh5+ 31.Kg2 Rd8 { Karpovian technique will not be required to win the game! } ) 27...Rxe5+ 28.Kh4 Bc8 { To defend against ...Rh6, White needs to give up pretty much all of his
remaining pieces. Krasenkow prudently decided not to prolong the agony. }
