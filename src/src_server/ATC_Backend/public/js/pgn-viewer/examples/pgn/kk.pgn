1. e4 {B44: Sicilian: Taimanov: 5 Nb5} 1... c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Nf6 7. N1c3 a6 8. Na3 d5 {White tried to stop this move. The white Pawns on e4 and c4 form what is known as the Maroczy Bind or Wall. This wall is supposed to restrain black in the center. Black played this move which sacrifices a Pawn in order to gain greater freedom of movement for his pieces. Is the sacrifice worth it? In this game - yes. In clear retrospect - no.} 9. cxd5 exd5 10. exd5 Nb4 11. Be2 Bc5 12. O-O {White may have missed his best chance for a win by making this natural move. Karpov himself provides us insight into this position, and how to refute the black gambit. Karpov played the following line against GM John vanderWiel in the 1987 SWIFT tournament in Brussels. 12. Be3! Bxe3 13. Qa4+! Nd7 14. Qxb4 Bc5 15. Qe4+ Kf8 16. O-O with advantage for white.} 12... O-O 13. Bf3 {White plays for the win. He reinforces his extra Pawn on d5 which black could have regained on move 11. How does black refute the loss of material? Watch how black paralyzes white, dominates the center, and gains control of more space. By move 19 white will be tied in knots.} 13... Bf5 14. Bg5 Re8 15. Qd2 b5 16. Rad1 Nd3 17. Nab1 {A natural retreat which avoids the Pawn fork on b4. Kasparov recommends the more active 17. d6! Ra7! (17... b4? 18. Bxa8 Qxa8 19. Bxf6 gxf6 20. Na4 bxa3 21. Nxc5 Nxc5 22 Qd5! Qxd5 23. Rxd5 Re5 24. Rxe5 fxe5 25. bxa3 makes a better ending for white.) 18. Nd5 with an unclear position.} 17... h6 18. Bh4 b4 19. Na4 Bd6 {Kasparov states in his book Garry Kasparov: New World Chess Champion, A position for which I had aimed in my preparatory analysis! Black has achieved obvious advantage. White scattered his minor pieces about on either flank and are quite unable to coordinate, the placement of the Knights being particularly depressing. But black has the wonderful duo of Bf5 and Nd3 which completely paralyzes all three white major pieces - a very rare occurrence in a practical game!} 20. Bg3 Rc8 21. b3 g5 22. Bxd6 Qxd6 23. g3 Nd7 {A very excel lent move. Black is not content to merely capture the d5 Pawn. Instead, he wants to reinforce the d3-Knight with Nd7-e5 and then play for an attack against the white King on the weakened light squares. In addition, this sets up a diabolical trap if white tries to recycle his a4-Knight to b2. For example, 24. Nb2 Qf6! 25. Nxd3 Bxd3 26. Qxd3 Ne5! trapping the white Queen. Believe it or not.} 24. Bg2 Qf6 25. a3 a5 26. axb4 axb4 27. Qa2 Bg6 {A good move indeed. Black will refute Nd2 with Re2. This move prevents white from driving away the Rook with Bf3. This is a refute to the refute. Simply stated this move prevents the freeing Nd2.} 28. d6 g4 29. Qd2 Kg7 30. f3 Qxd6 31. fxg4 Qd4+ 32. Kh1 Nf6 33. Rf4 Ne4 34. Qxd3 Nf2+ 35. Rxf2 Bxd3 36. Rfd2 Qe3 37. Rxd3 Rc1 {Who among us has the steady hand to play a move like this. Black offers to give up his Queen for a host of white pieces.} 38. Nb2 Qf2 39. Nd2 Rxd1+ 40. Nxd1 Re1+ 
0-1

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5
{
Welcome to game 13 and the GI---that's Grunfeld-Indian.  Fight from
the start.
}
4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3 c5 8. Qd2 O-O
{
So far on two minutes each.  GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo.  Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ...
}
9. Rc1 Qa5
{
Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinking. Kasparov has left the
stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. It's not in the
pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a little
presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As commentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from
New Jersey is here for a week.
}
10. Nf3 e6
{
And the "soon-to-be" GM Will Watson from England is here too.  "I
don't understand the GI" he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.  Time:
White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): "I predicted the
opening this morning. And so did many others."  Valvo: "I think this
shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked out for Kasparov". IM Levy
suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says: "I've seen this
before. But nobody can find a game with it."
}
11. d5 exd5 12. exd5 Re8 13. Be2
{
Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his fingers
impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all be
preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.
}
13... Bf5 14. O-O
{
The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit "fuzzy." The game hasn't
found its own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays the
Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is also
widely discussed.
}
14... Nd7
{
Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that GK might
be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his neck. The game is
still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for a deep think. Now he's
on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the stage. Valvo say: The
Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!  It's no "Deep Thought", but
the Mephisto Chess Computer IS already world champion in its class. No
one else dared to test their program against it!
}
15. h3
{
Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK hangs
over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the
Q-side.  And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be
pure gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece on
d6. Kasparov now "hangs" his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.
}
15... Nb6
{
GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4.
}
16. g4
{
Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start
suddenly the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the
pressroom find: 16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...
}
16... Bd7
{
Time: AK: 1:31 GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is
still under pressure, but improving. Mephisto "thinks" it's slightly
better for Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have
played h7-h5, not Nd7-b6.
}
17. c4 Qxd2 18. Nxd2 Na4 19. Bf3 Nc3 20. Rxc3 Bxc3 21. Ne4
{
The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at
deep think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4
now, and it is a draw.
}
21... Rxe4 22. Bxe4 Re8 23. Bd3 b6 24. Kg2
{
Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw will
get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has taken
place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3 should
have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.  If Karpov plays
Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame advantage with f4-f5) GK
might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame double-bishop ending. Draw.
}
24... f5 25. gxf5 Bxf5 26. Bxf5 gxf5
{
Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially
weaker than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think
that Black's still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but
right now it's quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since
Kg8 is too close.
}
27. Rd1 Kf7
{
Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock begins
to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4 Be5
30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better.
}
28. Rd3 Bf6 29. Ra3 a5 30. Rb3
{
Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact the
game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's weakness
on b6 or White's on c4?
}
30... Bd8
{
People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the initiative
is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news.  He said: "The
Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans think AK is
slightly better, and it might be a draw."
}
31. Rc3
{
Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems "speculative" now.  One point
in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4 34.Kd3 and Re4
has to move.
}
31... Bc7
{
Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left.
}
32. a4 Kf6 33. Kf1 f4
{
33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1.
}
34. Bc1 Kf5 35. Rc2 Rg8 36. Re2 Be5 37. Bb2 Bd4 38. Bxd4 cxd4 39. Re7 d3
40. Ke1 Rc8 41. Kd2 Rxc4
{
Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven moves
took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3 Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+
44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White might be the one who in
trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK is looking everywhere else,
waiting for Karpov to decide on if he wants to seal his move now. Some
say that Kasparov might have proposed a draw earlier on. Not
verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.  Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game
will be continued (maybe) tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.
}
{Draw agreed} 
1/2-1/2
