{ Black's active rook is counterbalanced by White's wonderfully-placed queen,
so unless Black whips up an immediate attack against White's king, the game
will probably end in a draw. To this end, the move 1...Qg6 is very tempting,
since after 2.Qxf8+ Kh7 White does not have any more checks and 3.g3 fails to
3...Qc2. However, White can refine his defense with 3.g4, when 3...Qc2 no
longer works on account of 4.Qf4. But Jacques Mieses, one of the greatest
tacticians of the early twentieth century, was not ready to give up just yet. } 1...Qg6!! ( 1...Rxg2+ 2.Kxg2 Qxf3+ 3.Kg1 Qg4+ 4.Kh1 Qf3+ 5.Kg1 { leads
only to a draw by perpetual. } ) 2.Qxf8+ { In retrospect, } ( 2.g3 Rxf3 3.Rb3 { was far more resilient, but here too, after } 3...Qf7 4.Rb5 Kg8 { White's position
is nearly hopeless, since } 5.Qxh5?? { fails to } 5...Rxg3+! 6.hxg3 Qf2+ { ,
mating. } ) 2...Kh7 3.g4! { White does not fall for 3.g3 and puts Mieses's
opportunistic sacrifice to the test. } ( 3.g3 Qc2 { and there is no good way to
stop mate along the second rank. } ) 3...hxg4 { Black must throw wood into the
fire before White extinguishes the attack. The threat of mate is renewed, and
White's king must flee the g-file. } ( 3...Qc2 4.Qf4 Rg2+ 5.Kh1 { and h2 is
defended! } ) 4.Kh1 { Once again, directly attacking h6 pawn leads nowhere, so
Mieses uses his pawn as a battering ram to intensify the attack. } 4...g3! { No
place is safe! Now, with the b8-h2 diagonal closed off, ...Qh5(6) indeed
becomes a threat, but it appears that he is a tepmo behind. } ( 4...Qh6? 5.Qb8 gxf3 6.Qe5 Qg6 7.Qe4 ) 5.Qf4 { At this point, N.N. (a sobriquet applied
to players whose identity is not known - it is short for Nomen Nescio, "I do
not know the name" in Latin) must have breathed a sigh of relief, since it
appears that Black's attack has fizzled out. Indeed, with the queen now fully
involved in the defense, it looks like the worst is behind him. } 5...Rxh2+ { Forced,
since neither } ( 5...g2+ 6.Kg1 { nor } ) ( 5...Qh5 6.Qxd2 Qxf3+ 7.Kg1 { are any
good. } ) 6.Kg1 { In considering 1...Qg6, many players would have stopped their
calculation here. After 6...Qc2 7.Qxg3 or 6...Qh5 7.Qxg3 the attack is over,
and White retains his extra rook. However, a pawn on g3(6) and a rook on the
h-file should immediately set off your tactical alarm. Although White's queen
is close, it still will not be able to parry an attack along the h-file... } 6...Rh1+!! { If the position before this move were given as a problem, I would
expect almost anyone - especially seasoned tacticians - to find ...Rh1+ in a
matter of seconds. However, if this position appears on move 6 of your
calculation, it is extremely difficult to see. Remember that there was no one
tapping Mieses on the shoulder, telling him to look for an unexpected mating
combination in the midst of his calculation. } 7.Kg2 ( 7.Kxh1 Qh5+ { Amazingly,
White's queen is totally helpless against the mating attack. } 8.Kg1 Qh2+ 9.Kf1 Qf2# ) 7...Qc2+ { Now, Black's own queen joins the fray, and White is
busted. } 8.Kxg3 Qh2+ 9.Kg4 Qh4# { A tremendous combination that could only be
unearthed through self-confidence, patience, cold-bloodedness, and, of course,
sharp tactical vision. }
