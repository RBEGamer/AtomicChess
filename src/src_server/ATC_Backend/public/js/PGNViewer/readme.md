## Summary

[PgnViewerJS](https://github.com/mliebelt/PgnViewerJS) allows to display chess games in various ways. The distribution (where this readme is a part of) contains all necessary files to integrate the viewer into your web application. To demonstrate the usage, the files  in the directory `examples` are included as well. So for a start, you may use the four examples to see the difference in the four modes:

* [Board](examples/board.html): Just display a chess board
* [View](examples/view.html): Allow to view a chess game, play the moves
* [Print](examples/print.html): Gives a print representation with multiple boards in it, but no interactive view
* [Edit](examples/edit.html): A variant to `View` that even allows to adapt the games (not finished yet).

See the documentation of the current version on [github pages](http://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/) for examples, documentation of the API and some background.
